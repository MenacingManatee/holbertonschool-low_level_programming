# Low-Level Programming

## About / synopsis
This repo includes all (to date) repositories utilizing low level languages in programming, namely C. Bash and blog posts are occasionally used.

## Built With

* [c] - Betty-style formatting
* [BASH] - Mainly one-line scripts
* [Blog posts] - Links in repo readme, mainly on Linkedin
