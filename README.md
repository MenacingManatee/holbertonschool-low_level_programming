# Low-Level Programming

## About / synopsis
This repo includes all (to date) holberton school repositories utilizing low level languages in programming, namely C. Bash and blog posts are occasionally used.

## Built With

* [c] - Betty-style formatting
* [BASH] - Mainly one-line scripts
* [Blog posts] - Links in repo readme, mainly on Linkedin

|0x04: C-More functions, more nested loops|More in depth/challenging tasks using nesting and loops|
|0x05: C-Pointers, arrays, and strings|Introduction to pointers, including arrays and strings|
|0x06: C-More pointers, arrays, and strings|Goes more in depth, manipulating pointers with other pointers|
|0x07: C-Even more pointers, arrays, and strings|First exposure to double pointers, goes more in depth on how pointers are displayed and stored in memory|
|0x08: C-Recursion|Introduction to using recursion in place of loops|
|0x09: C-Static Libraries|Introduction to the creation and uses of static libraries|
|0x0A: C-argc, argv|Introduction to sending arguments to main function|
